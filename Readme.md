# 🃏 Blackjack Game

## Overview

This is a simple Blackjack game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game allows you to play a round of Blackjack, draw new cards, and see if you can get a Blackjack (sum of 21). The game was created as a fun project to practice JavaScript functionality such as event handling, conditional logic, and random number generation.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start Game**: Click the "START GAME" button to begin your round of Blackjack. Two cards will be dealt to you, and the sum of the cards will be displayed.
2. **New Card**: If you are alive and haven’t gotten Blackjack, click the "NEW CARD" button to draw a new card. Your total card sum will update.
3. **Objective**: Try to get the card sum to 21 without going over. If you hit 21, you win with a Blackjack!

## 📋 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup and structure for the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game layout, including background, buttons, and text styles.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including card generation, sum calculation, and button interactivity.

## 🎨 Features

- Simple card drawing and sum calculation.
- Conditional logic to check if you’ve won or lost the game.
- Responsive and visually appealing design with hover effects.

## 💻 Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to play the game.
3. Modify the JavaScript or styling as desired to enhance the game.
